Adding a Selection Scheme 
===========================

:class:`~QMzyme.SelectionSchemes.SelectionScheme` is an `abstract base class (ABC)
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html>`_ used 
to prescribe concrete selection scheme classes. See the SelectionScheme class documentaion
for details on how to include your own selection scheme. Please note, if you submit a 
GitHub Pull Request to include a new selection scheme you will need to have also added
appropriate tests in the QMzyme/tests directory.
