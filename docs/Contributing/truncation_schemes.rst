Adding a Truncation Scheme 
===========================

:class:`~QMzyme.TruncationSchemes.TruncationScheme` is an `abstract base class (ABC)
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html>`_  used 
to prescribe concrete truncation scheme classes. See the TruncationScheme class documentaion
for details on how to include your own scheme. Please note, if you submit a 
GitHub Pull Request to include a new scheme you will need to have also added
appropriate tests in the QMzyme/tests directory.
