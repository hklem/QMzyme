QMzyme is a Python toolkit to facilitate (quantum mechanical) QM-based enzyme calculations. The GenerateModel module guides the process of generating calculation ready truncated or partitioned molecule regions. Any input file(s) accepted by MDAnalysis to create a Universe object can be used to start working in QMzyme. From there, the code relies on more flexible QMzyme objects: QMzymeAtom, QMzymeResidue, QMzymeRegion and QMzymeModel. 

Full documentation with installation instructions, technical details and examples can be found in [Read the Docs](https://hklem-qmzyme-documentation.readthedocs.io).
