*QMzyme is currently under-development. Please note the user interface may change! The first stable API version will be released as QMzyme==1.0.0 on PyPi.*

QMzyme is a Python toolkit to facilitate (quantum mechanical) QM-based enzyme calculations. The GenerateModel module guides the process of generating calculation ready truncated or partitioned molecule regions. Any input file(s) accepted by [MDAnalysis to create a Universe](https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/stable/universe.html) object can be used to start working in QMzyme. From there, the code relies on more flexible QMzyme objects: QMzymeAtom, QMzymeResidue, QMzymeRegion and QMzymeModel. 

Full documentation with installation instructions, technical details and examples can be found in [Read the Docs](https://hklem-qmzyme-documentation.readthedocs.io).
